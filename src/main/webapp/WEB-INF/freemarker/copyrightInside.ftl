    <p>UniTube is designed to facilitate the sharing of a wide range of educational materials between teaching staff and
        students. We feel it is important that staff and students are not confronted with a range of barriers and
        bureaucracy before they can share materials online for learning and teaching.</p>

    <p>Nonetheless, because material on UniTube may be accessed by users outside the University of Otago, it is very
        important that you are confident that you are the owner of that material or that you have the right to make it
        available to others before you upload it.</p>

	<h2>Need help?</h2>

	<p>If you are unsure about whether you can or should upload material, there are a number of Otago guides and
        resources that can help you (listed on the right).</p>

    <p>If you would like assistance to record video or audio material please contact <a
            href="mailto:ray.bretherton@otago.ac.nz">Ray Bretherton</a>,
        AV Producer, at the Audio Visual Support and Development Unit.</p>
