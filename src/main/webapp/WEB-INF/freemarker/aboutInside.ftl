    <p>UniTube is a hosting service provided for University of Otago staff and students to upload and share educational
        material. It is freely available for use by anyone with a university username and password.</p>

    <p>UniTube was created by the <a href="http://hedc.otago.ac.nz">Higher Education Development Centre</a>'s <a
            href="http://edmedia.otago.ac.nz">Educational Media</a> team. Our work integrates technology into teaching
        and learning activities within the University, helping teachers and students to achieve meaningful pedagogical
        outcomes. UniTube is intended to allow staff and students to collaborate and share resources that contribute to
        the student's learning and understanding.</p>

    <p>The <a href="http://hedc.otago.ac.nz">Higher Education Development Centre</a> can assist with and provide advice
        on how to use technology wisely in teaching and learning. Find out more about our work at <a
