        from audio and video to documents. The full list is available on the right.</p> <a href="${baseUrl}/webUploadGuide.do">Find out more about how to upload to UniTube.</a>

    <p>You can also upload your media files by emailing them from your Otago email address on any computer or
        internet-enabled mobile device. Attach your files to an email and send it to <a
                href="mailto:post2unitube@otago.ac.nz">post2unitube@otago.ac.nz</a>. <a href="${baseUrl}/emailUploadGuide.do">Find out more about how to upload via email.</a></p>

    <p>If youâ€™re uploading it's a good idea to check out our <a href="${baseUrl}/copyright.do">copyright and IP page</a>
        first. Please be aware that although UniTube is intended for use by Otago staff and students, uploaded files are
        available to view on the world wide web unless you select the 'Private' option when uploading.</p>

    <h2>Organise</h2>

    <p>You can organise your uploaded files into albums, making it easy for users to locate them. For example, you might
        want to create an album for each of the classes you teach so that students can search by paper code. You can
        even set permissions for each album, allowing specified users to contribute and collaborate. <a href="${baseUrl}/organiseAlbumsGuide.do">Find out more about organising your files with albums.</a></p>


    <h2>Share</h2>

    <p>You can copy and paste the link to your file to share it with whoever you like. You can share your files
        using social media such as <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>, or embed them in a web page or in Blackboard. <a href="${baseUrl}/blackboardShareGuide.do">Find out more about sharing your files on Blackboard.</a></p>

    <p>To make files easy to locate when browsing or searching, make sure that they have meaningful names and
        descriptions. You can also tag files with relevant keywords when you edit the file. </p>

    <h2>Tweet</h2>

    <p>If you want to post your activity on UniTube's Twitter feed, you can select this option when you upload your
        file. You can view recent uploads and comments other UniTubas have posted on the <a
                href="${baseUrl}/feedback.do">Twitter feed page</a>.</p>


    <h2><a name="rss">Subscribe</a></h2>

    <p>You can subscribe to a UniTuba or any one of their albums using RSS. You will need an RSS feed reader installed
        on your computer to do this. Click on the orange icon next to the name of a UniTuba or their album and set a
        notification to alert you by email each time something new is uploaded. </p>
