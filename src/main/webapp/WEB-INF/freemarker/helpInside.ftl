    <h2>Upload</h2>

    <p>Go to <a href="${baseUrl}/myTube/list.do">My Media</a> to get uploading. UniTube accepts a wide range of files,
        from audio and video to documents. See the full list on the right.</p>

    <p>You can also upload your media files by emailing them from your Otago email address on any computer or
        internet-enabled mobile device. Attach your files to an email and send it to <a
                href="mailto:post2unitube@otago.ac.nz">post2unitube@otago.ac.nz</a>. The title of your upload can be
        typed in the subject line and the description in the email body. If you attach several files they will all be
        uploaded separately, however they will all be given the same title and description.</p>

    <p>If you’re uploading it's a good idea to check out our <a href="${baseUrl}/copyright.do">copyright and IP page</a>
        first. Please be aware that although UniTube is intended for use by Otago staff and students, uploaded files are
        available to view on the world wide web unless you select the 'Private' option when uploading.</p>

    <h2>Organise</h2>

    <p>You can organise your uploaded files into albums, making it easy for users to locate them. For example, you might
        want to create an album for each of the classes you teach so that students can search by paper code. You can
        even set permissions for each album, allowing specified users to contribute and collaborate.</p>


    <h2>Share</h2>

    <p>You can copy and paste the link to your file to share it with whoever you like. You can also share your files
        using social media such as <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>.</p>

    <p>To make files easy to locate when browsing or searching, make sure that they have meaningful names and
        descriptions. You can also tag files with relevant keywords when you edit the file. </p>

    <h2>Tweet</h2>

    <p>If you want to post your activity on UniTube's Twitter feed, you can select this option when you upload your
        file. You can view recent uploads and comments other UniTubas have posted on the <a
                href="${baseUrl}/feedback.do">Twitter feed page</a>.</p>

    <h2>Embed</h2>

    <p>You can embed any file on a web page or in Blackboard. View the media file and copy the code in the ‘Embed’ box.
        If you paste this into the code of your site, your file will appear on the page. </p>


    <h2><a name="rss">Subscribe</a></h2>

    <p>You can subscribe to a UniTuba or any one of their albums using RSS. You will need an RSS feed reader installed
        on your computer to do this. Click on the orange icon next to the name of a UniTuba or their album and set a
        notification to alert you by email each time something new is uploaded. </p>
