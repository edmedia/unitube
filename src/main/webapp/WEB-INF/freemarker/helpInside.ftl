    <h2>Getting started with UniTube</h2>

    <p>UniTube is a service provided by Educational Media (HEDC) for University of Otago staff and students. This
        service is provided on an 'as is' basis and we are actively seeking your feedback to ensure that UniTube
        develops in a way that best supports the work of staff and students at the University of Otago.</p>

    <p>Start using UniTube by following the steps below:</p>
    <ol>
        <li> Click on Login. If you are from the University of Otago, simply log in using Blackboard. If not, either
            register as a new user or log in using your existing UniTube account. If you experience any difficulties
            logging in, please <a href="mailto:unitube@otago.ac.nz">contact us</a>.
        </li>
        <li>Once you have successfully logged in, you will be taken to My Media. On this page, you can upload a file and
            organise your files:
            <ul>
                <li>To upload a file, click on Browse and locate the file you want to upload. Click on Upload. The time
                    taken to process the file will depend on the file size. A message will appear indicating a
                    successful upload and you can now click on the link provided to view your file. Also, you can click
                    on My Media for a list of all your files.
                </li>
                <li>To organize your files, you have a few options:
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can organise your files into albums (e.g. "Students' Presentations", "My Lectures") by
                            selecting multiple files and then adding them to albums (create a new album if you have not
                            already done so). To specify users who are allowed to add media to your albums, you can set
                            permissions by clicking My Albums, selecting an album, and adding/removing users.
                        </li>
                        <li>You can also facilitate the retrieving of your files by tagging them: Simply click on Edit
                            and add Tags (e.g. "PERF301", "SimPharm").
                        </li>
                        <li>To give users more details of your file, add a description by clicking on Edit and writing a
                            short description.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
