    <h2>Organise with albums</h2>
    <ol>
<li>From your 'My Media' page, click on 'Create New Album'.</li>
<li>You will now be on the 'Edit album' page. The 'Album name' and 'Album description' fields will be blank. Give your new album a name, and optionally type in a description for it.</li>
<li>Select whether your album is to be 'Public' or 'Hidden'. Note that if an album is 'Public', it is important that all the media in it are also public. If an album is 'Hidden' then all media in it should also be hidden.</LI>
<li>Click 'Save'.</li>
<li>You will now see your new album listed on the 'My Albums' page.</li>
<li>Click on 'My Media' to return to the 'My Media' page.</li>
<li>Click on the check box next to media that you would like to add to your album.</li>
<li>Choose your new album from the drop down list 'Add to Album'.</li>
<li>The album name will appear next to the media you have chosen. Just to check, click on the album and you should see all the media you have listed from within the 'View Album' page. If you cannot see any or some of your media it will be because the media and the album are assigned different access levels: hidden or public. To check the access level of your album, click on ‘My Albums' from the ‘My Media' page and then click on the name of the album. This will open the 'Album edit' page and you can check or change the access type: ‘Public' or ‘Hidden'.</li>
 <li>In the 'My Albums' list, click on the album's URL to view its contents. You can reorder media within the album by dragging and dropping them into the right place.</li></ol>
